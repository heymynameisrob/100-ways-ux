Have you ever started a job and thought 'What the hell am I supposed to do here?' I once worked in a factory where my job was to pack boxes and ship them out. On my first day, they were super busy so they gave me some tape and boxes and said 'Go on, get to work'. I had no idea what I was doing. The people that worked there assumed I knew what they knew. Needless to say, a lot of stuff that was due to go out that day didnt. I also did stay there long.

Everyone has a nightmare first day story like this. Without a solid onboarding process, you're helpless to know what to do.

The same is true for products. Often times, companies expect users to 'just know' how to use their products. Or they leave them with a bunch of options, hoping they'll figure out what they need to do.

Lots of onboarding UX is at best a costly exchange for the user and at worst a fustrating experience. Yet, it's the first impression a new user has with your product. It's essential to get it right.

Here are 5 top tips your can apply to any onboarding process to make it seamless and effective.

## Understand the Job To BeÂ Done
Knowing what value you bring to users and why they are using your product or "hiring you" is essential. Without a good understanding of this you can't hope to onboard anyone properly. 

The best way to start figuring out your JTBD for your product is to talk to customers. Understanding what their problems are with help you define your jobs to be done. It could be as simple as asking them directly: 'Why do you use our product?'

> Understand what is motivating users and what end result they want. What job do they hire your product/feature for. E.g. People don't want to book a flight, they want to go on holiday.

## The Law of Reciprocity
Human beings by their very nature feel the need to help each other. Especially when someone has already helped us. Cultural anthropologists call this 'the web of indebtness'. It's key to our evolution. It allowed us form communities and tight social bonds. 

The law of reciprocity is key for figuring out how your onboarding should be structured. Think of your product as a human-to-human transaction. You wouldn't expect someone to go completely out there way without giving them an icentive or show them value first. However, the person who makes the first move will then trigger an debt with the other person which they will feel obliged to complete.

Make sure you give users something for signing up. Break out the information required into small chunks and give some value every step of the way.

## Utilise loading screens
Loading states are a required part of most applications. They are also boring for the user. Use loading screens to prime your users, getting them ready for what's ahead.

> Use visual clues or suggestions to help users remember information or know what's happening e.g. a vibrate when recording audio starts

Calm, the mediation app has a great example of this. When you first load up the app, whilst it's loading they ask you to 'breathe in' and 'breathe out'. This not only distracts the user from the loading times, but also primes the user for what's to come. It sets the right frame of mind for the experience.

## Show, don't tell
Walking through your product is another great move for onboarding. Users may have the problem you seek to solve (or they do and just don't know it yet). However, that doesn't mean they can instantly match your solution to it. You need to show them how your solution solves the problem. 

When writing copy, write from a users perspective. Use words like 'you' instead 'us'. Users need to be able imagine themselves using this product and picture how it can make their life better.

## Get to your Aha moment
Every product as an 'Aha moment'. That moment when everything just clicks in a users head. The goal of your onboarding it to get users to this as quickly as possible.

Think of Uber. Uber doesn't just start and end when you tap a few buttons and hail a ride. The 'Aha moment' is when your ride turns up when or before expected. That's when you realise how easier this was than taking a traditional cab or public transport. 

Because Uber is smart, after you've reached your 'Aha moment', it then asks you to review the app. This is when you're likely to be at your happiest, and more likely to leave a good review.

When getting to the 'Aha moment' you should utilise the Peak-End rule, focusing on maximising the impact of the positivity of reaching that moment.

> ðŸ§  Peak End Rule

> Users judge experiences by 'peaks' and 'ends'. Make sure the key moments (e.g. completing sign-up, creating their first post) are given importance and are rewarded.

The ultimate goal on onboarding is to get your user to recognise the value and understand what they have to do as quickly as possible. For most products, that means utilising the above strategies to get them using the app straight away. Complex products may need more time and hand-holding.
