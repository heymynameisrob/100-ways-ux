Have you ever started a job and thought 'What the hell am I supposed to do here?' I once worked in a factory where my job was to pack boxes and ship them out. On my first day, they were super busy so they gave me some tape and boxes and said 'Go on, get to work'. I had no idea what I was doing. The people that worked there assumed I knew what they knew. Needless to say, a lot of stuff that was due to go out that day didnt. I also did stay there long.

Starting somewhere new is nerve wrecking. Without a solid onboarding process, you're either thrown into the deep end like I was or you sit around aimlessly spending a lot of time thinking you should be doing something that you're not.

Everyone has a nightmare first day story like this. The same is true for products. Often times, companies expect users to 'just know' how to use their products. Or they leave them with a bunch of options, hoping they'll figure out what they need to do.

Lots of onboarding UX is at best a costly exchange for the user and at worst a fustrating experience. Yet, it's the first impression a new user has with your product. It's essential to get it right.

Here are 5 top tips your can apply to any onboarding process to make it seamless and effective.
